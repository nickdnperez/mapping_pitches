# mapping_pitches

Pitch 1
My mapping assignment would be somewhat of an explainer of Mayor de Blasio’s new affording housing plan. It first will explain what it is in very short detail. Then it will give his definition of affordable and examples of what the average income of couple neighborhoods that’s affected by the plan such as East New York and Flatbush.

On the map, I’ll have five to ten points where the general area of each neighborhood that’s effected. When you click on the points, it will say what’s the average income of the neighborhood. If I can find it, I would also include how much of the new units that are going to “affordable” and how much they will be for the residents.

Pitch 2
Related to my first pitch, I covered politics in East New York last semester. It’s the first neighborhood getting hit by Mayor de Blasio’s plan. My assignment would explain what’s going happen with the plan.

With the map part, I’ll map put where the 310 of 1,210 units are going to be. . I found a file where the rest of the units will be on private sites and didn’t show where going to be. I also found some of the sites are placed weird, so I might group them together. Finally, when you click on the individual sites, it will tell how many units that will be there, addresses. Also each point will color coded for the different sites but with the same name such as NCP and NIHOP.
